# Directory and File Management Script

This script is designed to create a series of directories and files, modify their creation dates, and handle multiple file extensions and directory names. The script consists of four main functions: `month()`, `days()`, `severalFiles()`, and `severalDirs()`.

- [Configuration](#configuration)
- [Important Notes](#important-notes)

## Setup

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. This script relies on standard Python libraries such as `os`, `time`, and `datetime`.

## Usage

### month()

Creates 12 directories, one for each month, in the `C:\teste\DATA_LAKE` directory. Each directory will contain a text file named `FileXX.txt` (where XX is the month number), with the modification date set to the first day of that month in the specified year.

```python
month()
```

### days()

Creates 30 subdirectories for each day of the specified month (default is July) in the `C:\teste\DATA_LAKE\month07` directory. Each subdirectory will contain a text file named `file_day_XX.txt` (where XX is the day number), with the modification date set to that day.

```python
days()
```

### severalFiles(severalext)

Creates files with various extensions (specified in the `severalext` list) for each day of the specified month (default is July) in the `C:\teste\DATA_LAKE` directory. Each file will have its modification date set to that day.

```python
severalFiles(severalext)
```

### severalDirs(severalDir)

Creates subdirectories for each specified directory name in the `severalDir` list in the `C:\teste\DATA_LAKE` directory. Each subdirectory will contain a text file named after the directory, with the modification date set to each day of the specified month (default is July).

```python
severalDirs(severalDir)
```

## Configuration

The script uses several configuration variables which can be modified to suit your needs:

- `num_months`: Number of months to create directories for (default is 12).
- `year`: Year for setting the modification dates (default is 2024).
- `num_month_days`: Number of days in the month to create subdirectories for (default is 30).
- `month_test`: Month number to use for the `days()`, `severalFiles()`, and `severalDirs()` functions (default is July).
- `severalext`: List of file extensions to use in the `severalFiles()` function.
- `severalDir`: List of directory names to use in the `severalDirs()` function.

## Important Notes

- Ensure the `C:\teste\DATA_LAKE` directory exists or has appropriate permissions for creating subdirectories and files.
- Modification dates are set using the `os.utime()` function, which may require appropriate permissions.
- Error handling is minimal; ensure your environment is set up correctly to avoid unexpected issues.

```python
import time
import os
import datetime

user_profile = os.environ['USERPROFILE']
#Change month and year
num_months = 12
year = 2024
num_month_days = 30
month_test = 7
severalext = [".TRN",".TRT",".ETP"]
severalDir = ["TESTE","EXEPT","JEW"]
